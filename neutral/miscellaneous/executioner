**Executioner** | Neutral Miscellaneous
__Basics__
The **executioner** receives a target at the beginning of the game. The target is always a member of the townsfolk. If the **executioner**'s target is lynched, the **executioner** wins and the game ends. If the target dies in any way other than being lynched, the **executioner** transforms into a fool.
The **executioner** autoloses if the remaining living players are all members of the same team, and/or roles that autolose under this condition.
