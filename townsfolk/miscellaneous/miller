**Miller** | Town Negative
__Basics__
The **miller** sees themself as *townie* and appears as mafia to all investigative roles. They will appear as as *mafioso* when lynched or when killed by someone other than the mafia. If there are no *mafiosi* in the setup, instead of appearing as *mafioso*, the **miller** will appear as another mafia role that is possible in the setup.
